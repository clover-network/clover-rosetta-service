/**
* Get Transaction Construction Metadata
* Get any information required to construct a transaction for a specific network. Metadata returned here could be a recent hash to use, an account sequence number, or even arbitrary chain state. It is up to the client to correctly populate the options object with any network-specific details to ensure the correct metadata is retrieved.  It is important to clarify that this endpoint should not pre-construct any transactions for the client (this should happen in the SDK). This endpoint is left purposely unstructured because of the wide scope of metadata that could be required.  In a future version of the spec, we plan to pass an array of Rosetta Operations to specify which metadata should be received and to create a transaction in an accompanying SDK. This will help to insulate the client from chain-specific details that are currently required here.

* Payloads is called with an array of operations and the response from `/construction/metadata`.

The array of operations provided in transaction construction often times can not specify all \"effects\" of a transaction (consider invoked transactions in Ethereum). However, they can deterministically specify the \"intent\" of the transaction, which is sufficient for construction. For this reason, parsing the corresponding transaction in the Data API (when it lands on chain) will contain a superset of whatever operations were provided during construction.
